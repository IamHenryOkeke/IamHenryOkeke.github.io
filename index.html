      <p>Hi, I'm Henry, The naija Tech guy and a lover of naija jollof rice. Jollof rice is my favorite because of its aroma and tastiness. One taste and you're glue. Plus it's highly nutricious </p>
      <!-- I hope no one sees this. I also love Ewa agoyin(Beans and oil stew). It's to die for. -->
  
      <p>I was born and bred in Lagos state in Nigeria. I guess you can call me a "Confam Lagos Boy". I'm currently in school. I'm a student of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I've worked as an office assistant and have experience working with Microsoft office tools particularly Microsoft Excel </p>
